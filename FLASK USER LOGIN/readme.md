I have developed an all-inclusive web application utilizing Flask, a powerful Python web framework, to provide a comprehensive user experience. This project incorporates user registration, login, and an essential To-Do app, all fortified by a robust OTP (One-Time Password) authentication system. Users can efficiently manage their tasks, ensuring their data is not only private but also accessed securely through OTP verification.

Key Features:

User Registration: New users can easily register by providing essential credentials, including a unique username and a secure password. Registration is the gateway to accessing the To-Do app.

OTP Authentication: To enhance security, the application includes OTP-based authentication. After successful registration, users receive a one-time password on their registered email or mobile number. They must enter this OTP to complete the registration process and access their accounts.

User Login: Registered users can securely log in by providing their username and password. OTP verification ensures that only authorized users can access their To-Do lists.

To-Do App Functionality: Once logged in, users can create, update, and delete tasks in their personalized To-Do lists. They can also mark tasks as completed and set due dates, simplifying task management.



Secure Data Storage: User data, including registration details, To-Do lists, and OTP authentication records, are securely stored in a database to guarantee data privacy and integrity.

User-Friendly Interface: The application boasts an intuitive and user-friendly interface, ensuring a seamless and pleasant experience when managing tasks.

Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive, making it accessible across various devices, such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

The "Flask User Login with To-Do App and OTP Authentication" project not only empowers users to efficiently manage their tasks but also adds an additional layer of security with OTP verification. This comprehensive solution promotes productivity, organization, and data security while offering a smooth user experience.
